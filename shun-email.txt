Hi Shun,

Sorry this is so late, here is the 10 descriptions of the videos:

Those doing the course should be able to code in object oriented programming languages preferably Java / JavaScript and be familiar with Git or at least do the tutorial linked in the introduction.

NodeJS:
1. An introduction, introducing NodeJS, use cases, and some terminology. Showing the class example for the first time. 
2. Systems design models, shown using the class example and introduce the small project to be done by participants. Introduce web systems.
3. Testing, testing frameworks and testing using the class example. Also what tests the small project should have and some diagrams.
4. Code patterns and some examples using the class example. Cohesion and Coupling, gang of four code patterns. Anti-patterns and avoiding them.
5. System topologies especially server-client. How NodeJS works with data. MongoDb databases. Will link up with class example and small project. Using data

6. Design methodologies for both web and android. Will look at making mock-ups and user interfaces. Again for class example and small project.

Android Development:
7. Introduction to Android development using class example, and previous designs.
8. Using data and web-sockets from a nodejs server. Getting and using data. Sending data back.
9. Android system controls, using the internal sensors in your programs. 
10. The class example final showcase, what should have been built ... maybe some more stuff here?
 
Thanks,
Jason Chalom
