They should be multiple choices with wrong answers and the right answers shown below

Quiz:

1. Why would you not use the waterfall model?
2. How does AGILE help to reduce scope creep problems?
3. Should layers in the layered architecture talk to anyother layers present in the system.
4. What is the main reason for using modular code?

Answers:
1. The waterfall model is very ridgid and it does not like to adapt to change which is present in modern web systems and the internet.
2. It ensures that the project grows slowly feature-by-feature which allows for the initial features to be implemented before moving on to newer features. The iterations control how many features can be present at each sprint cycle.
3. No they should only talk to sub layers connected to them and the layers directly above and below the specific layer in question.
4. To help with reusing code elsewhere and in other projects.
